Filming with a partner or team allows you to capture multiple angles and
perspectives. This can lead to more compelling video and may provide
better evidence in a court of law.

### Before
* Consider the intended audience and what shots you want to capture.
* Discuss and establish the roles of each team member. Assess the risks
associated with each role, such as arrest or injury. Confirm that the
filmers accept these risks.
* Develop an emergency plan in case violence breaks out or a team
member is injured.
* Determine how the team will communicate, e.g., by SMS or walkie talkies.
* Set the date and time on the camera(s).

### During
* Designate a point person or partner to carry essential materials such as
extra batteries, media cards, or emergency contact details. The partner
can also maintain communication between team members, search for
compelling shots and assist with interviews.
* Everyone should document the date, time and location and identify who is filming.
* Capture contextualizing details like the size of the crowd, police badge
numbers, or license plates.
* Be intentional with your shots and hold the camera steady.
* Maintain regular check-ins with the team to ensure everyone is safe.
* If anyone is arrested or detained, other team members should attempt to
film the incident and alert support networks.

### After
* Consolidate media and pass on to an editor, provide additional details
about the event if necessary.
* When uploading and sharing the footage, add context and details in the
description, tags and title of the video. This will make your video
easier to find and use.
* If necessary, blur faces of subjects to protect their identity.


# Roles & Responsibilities
## Camera 1 - Films Details and Action Shots
### Responsibilities

   Film the action as close as possible, focusing on details of the protest
and any incidents of police or military violence. Capture details and
identifying information such as faces, police names, badges, vehicles
and license plates.

## Camera 2 - Films the Crowd
### Responsibilities

   Film within the crowd to get a sense of the action. Try to keep Camera 1
in the shot to maintain context and provide additional angles. Before
filming, Camera 2 should determine whether or not to replace Camera 1 if
arrested or detained.

## Camera 3 - Films Establishing Shots
### Responsibilities

   Film at a distance to capture the full scope of the event. If safe,
document the location and movement of police or military. Consider
filming from a window, balcony or roof to get an aerial perspective.
Camera 3 should communicate any major developments to teammates, such as
approaching military vehicles, a new formation or acts of violence.

### Additional Equipment

   Camera with good zoom, tripod, monopod
or stabilizing surface

## Camera 4 - Films Interviews
### Responsibilities

   Provide contextualizing details through interviews with consenting
protestors or eye-witnesses. Ensure those you film are fully aware of
how and where the video will be used. Discuss potential safety risks if
the video is to be shared publicly, online or with authorities. If
anonymity is needed, film interviewees’ hands while they speak, have the
subject wrap their face in a scarf, or adjust the focus to blur the
image.

### Additional Equipment

   An external microphone, tripod or monopod are recommended.

## Editor & Uploader - Collects, Saves and Shares Footage
### Responsibilities

   The editor collects, analyzes and saves the footage. When uploading the
videos, they should incorporate the date, time, location and event
information into the videos’ title, description and tags. They can also
add informational title cards within the video and blur faces when
anonymity is needed. See instructions for using the YouTube Face
Blurring tool here: [http://bit.ly/yt-faceblur](http://bit.ly/yt-faceblur)

### Additional Equipment

   Internet access and external hard drives for backing-up footage.
   
### Partner

  Ideally, editing is done by a team of two or more. One person reviews
the raw footage while another focuses on editing the selected clips,
saving and sharing the footage. Additionally, a partner can communicate
with the filming team to get additional footage as needed.
